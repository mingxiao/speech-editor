We use the example eclipse java editor as a scaffold to build an editor that accepts speech input.

The speech input is processed by sphinx, and is then inputted into the editor.

Its a huge organizational mess right now, but the important bit is 

Eclipse Java Editor Example > org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor / JavaEditor.java

That is the main program that will initialize the plugin.
